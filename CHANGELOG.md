## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added
- **LLM Advisors mode**: Entirely new persona-driven debate system where named advisor personas argue your question across configurable rounds, reaching consensus or voting to deliver a structured verdict with action plan
- **10 built-in advisor personas**: The Skeptic, The Pragmatist, The Innovator, The Historian, The Ethicist, The Data Analyst, The Contrarian, The Strategist, The Humanist, and The Risk Assessor — each with unique system prompts, roles, emoji avatars, and color-coded identities
- **Persona customization**: Edit any persona's name, role, description, system prompt, and avatar emoji — overrides persist to `data/persona_overrides.json` with per-persona reset to defaults
- **Debate orchestration** (`backend/advisors.py`): Multi-round debate engine with rotating speaking order, consensus detection via `CONSENSUS:YES/NO` tags, automatic early termination on agreement, and tiebreaker invocation when advisors remain split
- **Structured verdict system**: Neutral analyst synthesizes debate transcript into Summary, Consensus Points, Disagreements table, Verdict, Recommended Next Steps, and Open Uncertainties
- **NVIDIA NIM provider** (`backend/providers/nvidia.py`): Native support for NVIDIA Build (NIM) models at `integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1` with `nvidia:` prefix routing, API key management, and model listing
- **Landing page** (`LandingPage.jsx`, `LandingPage.css`): New dual-mode entry screen with animated glass cards for "Enter Council" and "Start Advisory Session", custom SVG icons, gradient orbs, and grid background
- **Advisor Setup UI** (`AdvisorSetup.jsx`, `AdvisorSetup.css`): Full configuration panel with question input, model selection via `SearchableModelSelect`, round count slider, web search toggle, persona selection grid with inline editing, and glassmorphic styling
- **Debate View UI** (`DebateView.jsx`, `DebateView.css`): Live debate display with per-round sections, persona-colored response cards, consensus banners, tiebreaker section, verdict panel with copy-to-clipboard, and streaming progress indicators
- **Advisor Grid** (`AdvisorGrid.jsx`, `AdvisorGrid.css`): Visual grid showing active debate participants with round progress and active-speaker highlighting
- **Advisor API endpoints**: `POST /api/advisor/debate/stream` (SSE streaming debate), `GET /api/personas` (list all personas), `PATCH /api/personas/{id}` (save overrides), `DELETE /api/personas/{id}/override` (reset to default)
- **Advisor conversation persistence**: `add_advisor_message()` in storage saves full debate transcripts (rounds, verdict, tiebreaker, persona IDs) alongside existing council conversations
- **Advisor settings**: `advisor_default_model` and `advisor_default_rounds` fields in settings with validation (1–10 rounds, 2–4 advisors per debate)
- **NVIDIA SVG icon** (`frontend/src/assets/icons/nvidia.svg`) with provider detection in `CouncilGrid.jsx`

### Changed
- **App architecture**: `App.jsx` refactored to support dual-mode routing — landing page → council mode or advisors mode, with independent state management for each
- **Sidebar**: Updated to show mode-aware conversation list with Home button navigation back to landing page
- **`SearchableModelSelect`**: Now normalizes dashes to spaces during search so NVIDIA model names (e.g., `nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1`) match correctly
- **CouncilGrid provider detection**: NVIDIA prefix (`nvidia:`) added to provider icon lookup chain
- **Settings UI**: NVIDIA API key section added to Provider Settings with test/save flow
- **`ChatInterface`**: Extended to support both council and advisor question submission flows
- **`llm-council-api` skill updated to v1.0.0**: Documents advisor endpoints, persona API, NVIDIA provider, and dual-mode architecture

## [0.4.2] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- **AGENTS.md canonical agent guide**: Single source of truth for AI agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI) working in this repository — replaces scattered instructions across CLAUDE.md and GEMINI.md
- **Admin endpoint security** (PR #9): `/api/settings/export`, `/api/settings/import`, and `/api/settings/reset` now require `LLM_COUNCIL_ADMIN_TOKEN` when accessed by remote or proxied clients. Direct loopback clients are still allowed without a token. Thanks @jonathanzhan1975!

### Changed
- **Jina Reader fetch hardening** (PR #9): Stricter URL validation before fetching full article content via Jina Reader. Thanks @jonathanzhan1975!
- **Docker entrypoint escaping** (PR #9): Config values injected into `config.js` are now properly escaped to prevent shell injection. Thanks @jonathanzhan1975!
- **Docs reconciliation** (PR #10): CLAUDE.md slimmed to a pointer at AGENTS.md; stale GEMINI.md archived to `docs/archive/`. Thanks @jonathanzhan1975!
- **Admin security variables documented**: `LLM_COUNCIL_ADMIN_TOKEN` usage added to AGENTS.md and `docs/DOCKER.md`
- **Custom endpoint error messages improved**: Timeout and connection errors now display actionable messages (e.g., "Request timed out after 120s") instead of "Unknown error"

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- **`POST /api/ask` one-shot endpoint**: Single call, no conversation state, returns JSON directly. Accepts `models`, `chairman_model`, `web_search`, and `execution_mode`. Ideal for scripts and MCP agents.
- **`POST /api/conversations/{id}/message` sync endpoint**: Non-streaming JSON alternative to SSE. Saves to conversation history without requiring event stream parsing.
- **Per-request model overrides**: `council_models` and `chairman_model` fields on both streaming and sync message endpoints. Never mutates global config for ad-hoc queries.
- **`PipelineResult` dataclass**: Shared orchestration helper (`_run_council_pipeline`) eliminates duplicated stage1/2/3 collection logic across sync endpoints.
- **Multi-turn conversation memory**: Conversation endpoints pass full prior chat history to models. Follow-up questions carry context automatically.
- **MCP `chat` tool**: Multi-turn equivalent of `quick_chat` — pass `conversation_id` to continue a conversation with memory. (14 tools total)
- **UI: single-model council support**: Council members can now be reduced to 1 in the Settings UI (was minimum 2).
- **UI: chairman auto-disables**: Chairman section dims and becomes non-interactive when execution mode is not "Full Deliberation".

### Changed
- **Minimum council models reduced to 1**: Single-model queries are now valid for any execution mode (was 2 minimum).
- **`execution_mode` uses `Literal` type**: Pydantic rejects invalid values at parse time instead of runtime checks in each handler.
- **Settings cache**: `get_settings()` now uses mtime-based caching — repeated calls within the same request return the cached instance instead of re-reading disk (eliminates 5-10 redundant file reads per deliberation).
- **Storage I/O reduced**: `add_user_message()` and `add_assistant_message()` accept pre-loaded `conversation` kwarg, avoiding redundant reads after 404 checks.
- **Web search setup deduplicated**: Shared `_apply_search_env()` and `_fetch_search_context()` helpers replace 3 copy-pasted blocks (also fixes missing Serper env var in sync/oneshot paths).
- **Dead import removed**: `from .search import perform_web_search, SearchProvider` removed from `council.py` (unused there).
- **MCP `quick_chat` uses `/api/ask`**: No more save/restore of global settings — calls one-shot endpoint directly.
- **MCP `run_deliberation` uses per-request overrides**: Passes `council_models` in stream body instead of mutating settings with try/finally restore.
- **MCP client `ask()` method added**: `CouncilClient.ask()` wraps `POST /api/ask` for one-shot queries.
- **MCP client `stream_message` accepts overrides**: `council_models` and `chairman_model` params added to avoid settings mutation.
- **`llm-council-api` skill updated to v0.4.1**: Documents `/api/ask`, per-request overrides, sync endpoint, multi-turn conversations, SSE event table, and "Choosing the Right Endpoint" decision matrix.
- **`DEFAULT_EXECUTION_MODE` constant**: Extracted shared default (`'full'`) to `api.js` — eliminates magic string duplication across `App.jsx`, `Settings.jsx`, `CouncilConfig.jsx`.
- **`.subsection--disabled` CSS class**: Replaces inline opacity/pointer-events with reusable class (consistent with `.source-disabled`).
- **Chairman `SearchableModelSelect` respects disabled state**: `isDisabled` prop wired so keyboard users cannot change chairman when irrelevant.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Settings export/import/reset endpoints**: `GET /api/settings/export` returns a full settings backup including actual API key values; `POST /api/settings/import` restores from a backup blob; `POST /api/settings/reset` wipes all settings to factory defaults
- **4 new MCP tools** (17 total): `set_api_key` — set any provider API key by name; `export_config` — backup full config as JSON; `import_config` — restore config from JSON string; `reset_config` — factory reset
- **Extended `configure_council` MCP tool**: now accepts `stage1_prompt`, `stage2_prompt`, `stage3_prompt`, `enabled_providers`, and `direct_provider_toggles` in addition to existing parameters
- **Sidebar delete button always visible**: trash icon now shows at 40% opacity on all conversations (was hover-only), brightens to full on hover
- **18 new tests**: backend export/import/reset endpoint tests, MCP tool tests for all new tools, and client method tests (108 total, up from 90)

### Changed
- **`llm-council-api` skill updated to v0.4.0**: documents system prompt fields, `enabled_providers`/`direct_provider_toggles` dict formats, all API key field names, and backup/restore endpoints
- **`import_settings` endpoint simplified**: uses Pydantic body parsing (`Settings` model) instead of manual JSON parsing — FastAPI now returns field-level 422 validation errors instead of generic 400s
- **`export_settings` endpoint**: uses `model_dump_json()` (single-pass) instead of `model_dump()` + `json.dumps()` (two-pass)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- **MCP server** (`llm_council_mcp/`): Expose LLM Council Plus as a Model Context Protocol server, letting Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and other MCP clients send questions to the council and retrieve deliberation results programmatically
- **13 MCP tools**: `list_models`, `get_council_config`, `configure_council`, `set_search_provider`, `run_stage1`, `run_stage2`, `run_stage3`, `run_deliberation`, `quick_chat`, `list_conversations`, `get_conversation`, `check_health`, `test_provider`
- **stdio transport** (default): MCP server runs as a local process; AI tools communicate via stdin/stdout with outbound HTTP to the Council backend (local or remote)
- **SSE transport**: MCP server runs as an HTTP server on port 8002; AI tools connect via URL with no local installation required
- **TinyFish search provider**: 5th web search option using TinyFish's free-tier Fetch API (5 req/min); requires free API key from agent.tinyfish.ai
- **90 tests**: backend TinyFish provider tests, MCP integration tests covering all 13 tools and both transport modes
- **`docs/mcp/`**: Comprehensive MCP documentation including transport selection guide, step-by-step setup for stdio and SSE, full tools reference, and real-world usage examples
- **`llm-council-api` Claude Code skill** (`skills/llm-council-api/SKILL.md`, v0.3.0): Installable skill for interacting with the Council via REST API without MCP — covers all endpoints, SSE parsing, error handling, and troubleshooting

## [0.2.3] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- **Docker support** (PR #5): Single-container deployment via `docker compose up -d --build` serving both frontend and API on port 8001. Thanks @kcelsi!
- **Docker healthcheck**: Backend liveness polling via `/api/health` every 30s with automatic restart on failure
- **Non-root container user**: Container now runs as `appuser` for reduced attack surface
- **`docs/` directory**: New structured documentation folder
- **`docs/DOCKER.md`**: Comprehensive Docker deployment guide covering environment variables, persistent storage, Ollama integration, reverse proxy setup (nginx/Caddy with SSE notes), upgrades, and troubleshooting

### Changed
- **CORS hardening**: Dev-ports regex (`5173|5174|3000`) is now suppressed when the built frontend is present (Docker/production mode) — same-origin deployments no longer expose API to external dev-port origins
- **Root cleanup**: Removed stub `main.py`; moved `QUICKSTART.md` and `TEST_PLAN_SEARCH.md` into `docs/`
- **README**: Docker section condensed to quick-start + link to `docs/DOCKER.md`; stale CORS description updated

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-18
